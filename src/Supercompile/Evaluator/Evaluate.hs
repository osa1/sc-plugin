-- We used to garbage-collect in the evaluator, when we executed the rule for update frames. This had two benefits:
--  1) We don't have to actually update the heap or even claim a new deed
--  2) We make the supercompiler less likely to terminate, because GCing so tends to reduce TagBag sizes
--
-- However, this caused problems with speculation: to prevent incorrectly garbage collecting bindings from the invisible "enclosing"
-- heap when we speculated one of the bindings from the heap, we had to pass around an extra "live set" of parts of the heap that might
-- be referred to later on. Furthermore:
--  * Finding FVs when executing every update step was a bit expensive (though they were memoized on each of the State components)
--  * This didn't GC cycles (i.e. don't consider stuff from the Heap that was only referred to by the thing being removed as "GC roots")
--  * It didn't seem to make any difference to the benchmark numbers anyway
--
-- You might think a good alternative approach is to:
-- 1. Drop dead update frames in transitiveInline (which is anyway responsible for ensuring there is no dead stuff in the stack)
-- 2. "Squeeze" just before the matcher: this shorts out indirections-to-indirections and does update-frame stack squeezing.
--    You might also think that it would be cool to just do this in normalisation, but then when normalising during specualation the enclosing
--    context wouldn't get final_rned :-(
--
-- HOWEVER. That doesn't work properly because normalisation itself can introduce dead bindings - i.e. in order to be guaranteed to
-- catch all the junk we have to GC normalised bindings, not the pre-normalised ones that transitiveInline sees. So instead I did
-- both points 1 and 2 right just before we go to the matcher.
--
-- HOWEVER. Simon suggested something that made me realise that actually we could do squeezing of consecutive update frames and
-- indirection chains in the evaluator (and thus the normaliser) itself, which is even cooler. Thus all that is left to do in the
-- GC is to make a "global" analysis that drops stuff that is definitely dead. We *still* want to run this just before the matcher because
-- although dead heap bindings don't bother it, it would be confused by dead update frames.
