-- Note [Floating h-functions past the let-bound variables to which they refer]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- This seems like a reasonable thing to do because some variables will become free after supercompilation.
-- However, there really isn't much point doing the float because I won't be able to tie back to the floated thing
-- in any other branch.
--
-- Indeed, allowing such tiebacks may be a source of bugs! Consider a term like:
--
--  x |-> <10>
--  x + 5
--
-- After supercompilation, we will have:
--
--  15
--
-- Since we check the *post supercompilation* free variables here, that h function could be floated
-- upwards, so it is visible to later supercompilations. But what if our context had looked like:
--
--   (let x = 10 in x + 5, let x = 11 in x + 5)
--
-- Since we only match phantoms by name, we are now in danger of tying back to this h-function when we
-- supercompile the second component of the pair!
--
-- Conclusion: don't bother with this rubbish.
--
-- Note [Variables reachable from let-bindings]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- TODO: we shouldn't lambda-abstract over any variables reachable via the let-bound thing. Doing so needlessly
-- passes them around via lambdas when they will always be available in the closure.
--
-- Consider this example:
--
--   \y -> let x = \z -> .. too big to inline ... y ...
---        in (... x ..., ... x ...)
--
-- When supercompliing each component of the pair we might feel tempted to generate h-functions lambda abstracted over
-- y, but doing so is pointless (just hides information from GHC) since the result will be trapped under the x binding anyway.

-- Note [Where to residualise fulfilments with FVs]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Be careful of this subtle problem:
--
--  let h6 = D[e1]
--      residual = ...
--      h7 = D[... let residual = ...
--                 in Just residual]
--  in ...
--
-- If we first drive e1 and create a fulfilment for the h6 promise, then when driving h7 we will eventually come across a residual binding for the
-- "residual" variable. If we aren't careful, we will notice that "residual" is a FV of the h6 fulfilment and residualise it deep within h7. But
-- what if the body of the outermost let drove to something referring to h6? We have a FV - disaster!
--
-- The right thing to do is to make sure that fulfilments created in different "branches" of the process tree aren't eligible for early binding in
-- that manner, but we still want to tie back to them if possible. The bindFloats function achieves this by carefully shuffling information between the
-- fulfilments and promises parts of the monadic-carried state.
