        -- TODO: I didn't implement this idea. It has to go into the splitter anyway.
        --
        -- We can treat the top level specially in the following way - any HeapBindings in the initial state that
        -- *have no free variables* may be turned into LetBound things. This has the following benefits:
        --  1. Matching such things can be done nominally
        --  2. The supercompiler pretty-printer output is nicer (we often omit LetBound things from the output)
        --
        -- The no-bound-FVs check accomplishes two things:
        --  1. It satisfies the invariant that no LambdaBound thing can be referred to by a LetBound thing (FIXME: still required??)
        --  2. It ensures that residualising that binding right here does not cause remove some linearity
        --  3. We sidestep the bug that can occur where specialisations of LetBound HeapBindings are not made
        --     if one of their free variables get refined by a case expression (FIXME: not really??)
        --
        -- It is uniquely OK to do this at *top* level because otherwise we will end up trapping specialisations
        -- lower down in the specialised output where they cannot be reused.

-- Especially when we do eager value splitting, we might never actually match against the RHS of a binding like (map = \f xs -> ...).
-- This "hack" is designed to work around this issue by doing some eager value splitting of our own on lambdas.
--
-- It's cool to use normalise here instead of termToAnswer just in case we can do some sweet stuff like look through
-- lets in the body or maybe even simplify a case given the stuff in the heap. (NB: there this does not cause work dup.)
-- I won't go as far as using "speculate" because in that case "eta" could potentially yield an infinite list

--
-- NB: given an unfolding (f = \x y -> e) will return memo entries for all the states (\x y -> e), (\y -> e), e, f, (f x) and (f x y).

-- Note [Order of speculation]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- It is quite important that are insensitive to dependency order. For example:
--
--  let id x = x
--      idish = id id
--  in e
--
-- If we speculated idish first without any information about what id is, it will be irreducible. If we do it the other way
-- around (or include some information about id) then we will get a nice lambda. This is why we speculate each binding with
-- *the entire rest of the heap* also present.
--
-- Note [Nested speculation]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Naturally, we want to speculate the nested lets that may arise from the speculation process itself. For example, when
-- speculating this:
--
-- let x = let y = 1 + 1
--         in Just y
-- in \z -> ...
--
-- After we speculate to discover the Just we want to speculate the (1 + 1) computation so we can push it down into the lambda
-- body along with the enclosing Just.
--
-- We do this by adding new let-bindings arising from speculation to the list of pending bindings. Importantly, we add them
-- to the end of the pending list to implement a breadth-first search. This is important so that we tend to do more speculation
-- towards the root of the group of let-bindings (which seems like a reasonable heuristic).
--
-- The classic important case to think about is:
--
-- let ones = 1 : ones
--     xs = map (+1) ones
--
-- Speculating xs gives us:
--
-- let ones = 1 : ones
--     xs = x0 : xs0
--     x0 = 1 + 1
--     xs0 = map (+1) ones
--
-- We can speculate x0 easily, but speculating xs0 gives rise to a x1 and xs1 of the same form. We must avoid looping here.
--
-- Note [Speculation termination]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- I was trying to work out why speculation was so slow on programs like $fReadInteger that used parser combinators.
-- I never really worked it out, but I did find a possible problem. Consider this program:
--
--  foo |-> \x -> let f = let a = snd3 (foo x) in \y -> ...
--                    g = let b = thd3 (foo x) in \y -> ...
--                    h = let c = fst3 (foo x) in \y -> ...
--                in (f, g, h)
--  bar |-> foo z
--
-- With a tree-like history, we might speculate like this:
--   bar -> f -> a -> b -> c -> a (!RB)
--          g -> b -> c -> a -> b (!RB)
--          h -> c -> a -> b -> c (!RB)
--
-- So we end up making O(n^2) calls to reduce.
--
-- My approach to preventing this sort of problem is to *thread* the history. The only thing we have to be careful of
-- is that we don't roll back to a "node" which has already itself been rolled back (since that leads to a loop). This
-- concern motivates us also threading the "forbidden" set and keeping track of "parents" using ids from "ids".
--
-- With this approach we get something more like:
--   bar -> f -> a -> b -> c -> a (!RB)
--          g -> b (!STOP)
--          h -> c (!STOP)
--
-- Note [Old speculate]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- An older verison of speculate only allowed speculated bindings to see *values* in the heap, and tried to
-- drive the heap in topological order so that as many dependent terms were reduces to values as possible
-- before reaching the terms that used them.
--
-- However, I don't seem to have a good justification for doing this rather than the more obvious
-- plan of just speculating heap bindings one by one in some arbitrary order but with all heap bindings
-- simultaneously available.
--
-- (CHSC introduced the values-only behavior in 29db9669 with no comments and in the same commit that added rollback,
-- and the behaviour was imported to GHC from there.)
--
-- Note [Rollback in threaded histories]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- I used to prevent any rollback at all when we detected a termination test failure against a non-ancestor.
-- But this leads to some annoying behaviour, such as a |iterate not True| binding getting speculated to:
--   let xs0 = x1 : xs1
--       x1 = False
--       xs1 = x2 : xs2
--       x2 = True
--       xs2 = x3 : xs3
--       x3 = not x2
--       xs3 = iterate not x3
--   in Just xs0
--
-- Which then prevents deforesting the |not| calls because we can't push the non-value x3 into the
-- drive of the recursive call |iterate not x3|, since it's used non-linearly!!!
--
-- I fixed this by rolling back to the common ancestor of the two states, which in this case means that
-- iterate doesn't get speculated at all. When doing this we have to be very careful that we don't
-- test the termination condition against values because otherwise if we speculated two different |True|
-- bindings at top level we would roll back to the start of "speculate" and as a result wouldn't speculate
-- anything in that heap at all!

-- Note [Lets created by reduce are special]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Consider:
--   let x = True
--   in iterate not x
--
-- Reduce [#]:
--   let x = True
--       y = not x
--       ys = iterate not y
--   in x : ys
--
-- Split (x is non-linear but value):
--   let x = True
--       y = not x
--   in iterate not y
--
-- Reduce [*]:
--   let x = True
--       y = not x
--       z = not y
--       zs = iterate not z
--   in y : zs
--
-- Split (y is non-linear but not value):
--   let z = not y
--   in iterate not z
--
-- So in fact we don't get good results without *any* speculation. But notice that if we try to speculate
-- with rollback to common ancestor, then the heap in step [#] will roll back so that no speculation
-- occurs at all, since speculating "iterate not y" eventually speculates something that embeds into "not x"
-- and so we roll back to the common ancestor with "y = not x" i.e. the top level!
--
-- For this reason I have decided to treat the top level of lets as special i.e. don't allow rolling back
-- in such a way that it prevents speculation of the entire top level. I'm still rolling back to an enclosing
-- speculateMany for the recursive calls, though..

-- FIXME: if I speculate roughly in dependency order then GHCs inlining heuristics will have more information
-- to work with in the reduce invocations

-- Our custom ordering function ensures we get the following ordering:
--  1. Kind variables
--  2. Type variables
--  3. Dictionary ids
--  4. Other ids

-- The reason we want to sort dictionary ids earlier is so that GHC's own Specialise
-- pass is able to specialise functions on them (it assumes they come after the type vars).
